# hello-world
Charlie learning what it's all about (fingers crossed)

Feeling: confused [what are numbers at side? Why when I opened square brackets did it underline?!]
Also feeling: hopeful to be able to learn this.
Still not 100% sure what the README is; an overall file that describes the project?
What do these different line numbers imply? Let's just give it a go...
*written after clicking commit; the text in the README didn't correspond to the new lines in this edit section. Star seems to induce italics but unsure if this will translate to the README?*

Charlie learning what it's all about (fingers crossed)

Feeling: confused [what are numbers at side? Why when I opened square brackets did it underline?!]
Also feeling: hopeful to be able to learn this.
Still not 100% sure what the README is; an overall file that describes the project?
What do these different line numbers imply? Let's just give it a go...
